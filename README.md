# Instagram (but not really)
I made an Instagram clone so I could post memes and stalk myself!

Includes user authentication, auto-compressed image uploads, likes, comments, followers and suggestions

[Demo](https://suspicious-meitner-4803ad.netlify.app/)

Some UI elements are purely visual and don't have any functionality

Things left to do and/or fix:

<ul>
  <li>Login page refreshes on first login attempt but not the second</li>
  <li>Username doesn't get updated in post likes collection after user edits profile</li>
  <li>Add double tap to like functionality on touchscreen devices</li>
  <li>Infinite load posts</li>
  <li>Too much repetitive code (DRY)</li>
  <li>Performance - make it load faster</li>
</ul>
